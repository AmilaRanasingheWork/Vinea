# Vinea
Vinea is a web program where a customer or other entity can search for different kinds of wines and get additional information regarding specific wine. The program was created using ASP.NET Core frame. HTML + CSS was used for the visual aspect of the program. (The program will be developed further). 

UPDATE: Vinea web program is under maintenance at the moment! It should be back and running again at the end of November.
